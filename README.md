# Random Quote Machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This project was originally created as a project from the FreeCodeCamp

It was originally built in codepen by importing React manually. 

This repository is the same code but moved into the structure of a CRA App. 

### The Technologies that went into building this app
It uses react's useState and useEffect hooks to work with functional components. 

It uses useEffect combined with javascript's Fetch to get data from the quotes database API. 

useEffect is used with a dependency array to prevent too many calls to the API and to only make a new call when the page is refreshed or the button is pressed for a new quote.
